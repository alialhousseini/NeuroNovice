Welcome to the Neural Network Architectures repository! This project aims to demystify various neural network architectures by providing detailed implementations and explanations in Jupyter Notebooks, accompanied by their original research papers and additional resources.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific neural network architecture. These notebooks not only implement the networks in PyTorch but also delve into the theories, intuitions, and details behind each architecture, making it an invaluable resource for both learning and teaching.

## Features

- **Detailed Implementations:** Each neural network architecture is implemented in PyTorch within a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Comprehensive Explanations:** Accompanying each implementation is a thorough explanation, including the network's foundational theory, practical applications, and a walkthrough of the code.
- **Research Papers:** Direct links to the original research papers are provided for further reading and deeper understanding.
- **Interactive Learning:** By leveraging Jupyter Notebooks, users can interact with the code, experiment with different parameters, and see the results in real time.
